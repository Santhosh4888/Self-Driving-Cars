To run project :
1. In one terminal, start the CARLA simulator at a 30hz fixed time-step:

CarlaUE4.exe /Game/Maps/RaceTrack -windowed -carla-server -benchmark -fps=30

2. In another terminal, change the directory to go into the "Course1FinalProject" folder, under the "PythonClient" folder.

Run your controller, execute the following command while CARLA is open:
python module_7.py


3. The client will close once you reach the final waypoint, or after around 200 to 250 in-game seconds have passed. After the simulation completes, a text file containing the trajectory generated by your controller is saved. This file is called "trajectory.txt" and it is located inside the "controller_output" folder under the "Course1FinalProject" folder. The plots for speed, throttle, brake, steering and the executed 2D trajectory are also saved into this folder.

To run the grading script, execute the following command from the "Course1FinalProject" directory in a new terminal:

python grade_c1m7.py racetrack_waypoints.txt /controller_output/trajectory.txt
